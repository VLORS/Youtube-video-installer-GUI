A simple video search and download app

Having [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and added to system variables is highly recommended but not really necessary

Features i plan to add (hopefully)
---------------------------------
- Better search results
- A page feature 
- Search filters (search for channels, playlists, Upload date, etc.)
- better UI/UX
---------------------------------

Feel free to contribute
